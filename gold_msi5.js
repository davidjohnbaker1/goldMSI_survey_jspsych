// The code above here creates an object called trial, which we will call later when we run the timeline.
// Essentially, the code is saying "Make a variable 'var' and call it intro.
// It is going to need to code from the plugins file called 'instructions' (we called it at the top of the script) 
// And each page is just a string of text, "Which means we have to put it in quotes!" with commas between each set of pages.
// I also have a bit of HTML formatting in there, so if you know a bit of HTML you can make it look a little prettier.
// Lastly, the final bit of code, show_clickable_nav: , just says we want our participants to be able to click back and forth on this object.
// Try to set it to false and see what happens.
// Try to add in a new page in this object by adding a comma after the last statment and adding in some new text
// that is surrounded by quotes!

// Create Scales To Be Used
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

// In order to use the Likert scale functions in jsPsych, we need to create each scale we want to use.
// The beauty of doing this is that each time we want to use the same seven point response,
// we don't have to recreate the scale, we have to just call 'likert_7' in this case.
// Notice there is a unique object for every scale needed.

/// Create Seven point Likert Scale For First Four Pages

var likert_7 = ["Strongly Disagree", "Disagree", "Somewhat Disagree", "Neutral", "Somewhat Agree", "Agree", "Strongly Agree"];

/// Create Occupation Scale

			"Self-employed", "Homemaker/Full-time parent", 
			"Unemployed", "Retired"];

/// Genre Scale (Original GMSI) 
var genre_scale = ["Rock/Pop", "Jazz", "Classical Music"];
