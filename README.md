# Gold MSI Survey: jsPsych Implementation

This repository contains all materials needed to run the self report survey for the Goldsmiths Musical Sophistication Index.
All information to run this locally is provided and is written for those unfamiliar with github and jsPsych so they can understand what is happening in the code, not be intimidated by it, and thus hopefully start to contribute to creating more #musicscience tools for the community to use.

## Getting the Gold MSI Files 

The first thing you will want to do if you want to use these files in your own reserach is download this repository.
You can do this by clicking on the green 'Clone or download' button near the top of the page.
This will download everything you need to run this survey locally on your machine.
It will also download an R Script that will score each survey. 
Of course there is also a way of doing this at the command line, but if you know that you probably are not reading this anyway.

Once you have this repository downloaded, unzip the file where you would like it on your computer.
The file will have a copy of this README file, as well as an html file used to run the experiment and a js file that contains all of the scales needed.
After this has been set up you then need to download jsPsych so that these scripts will run.
 
## The jsPsych Library

jsPsych is an open source library that is made for running experiments in the web browser.
Download it by going the repository [here](https://github.com/jspsych/jsPsych) and then clicking the green 'Clone or download' button.
If you 'Dowload ZIP', then your browser will save the file and its contents to your downloads. 
Move that file to inside the goldMSI_survey_jspsych folder and then unzip it.

This will allow you to access all of jsPsych's libraries and make the Gold MSI run.

## Exploring the Scripts

Inside both the .html and the .js files are lines of code that begin with a //.
I have provided comments as to what each block of code is doing in order to help 
someone that is new to this better understand how the code is functioning.
