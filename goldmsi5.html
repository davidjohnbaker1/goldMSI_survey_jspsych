// The Header


// Above this line is the header of the main .html file. This part of the script lets this file know where to look for the files needed to run the experiment.
// Notice that each one says "jspsych-5.0/something-or-other.js". Those file paths are written in reference to where this file is currently located.
// So you will notice that in the directory where THIS file lives, there is also the jspsych-5.0/ directory which has in it a plugins/ directory, which 
// in it has all the files needed that run in the background to make it possible to write these experiments.
//
// You are always going to need the first two lines, as well as the last one which just makes it look pretty.
// The middle lines (which I have added a space on either side) are the ones you add in as needed. 
// For this survey we only need the instructions, THIS ONE, and THIS ONE.

// This line of code just calls the objects needed to run the experiment.
// It's often helpful to put the objects and scales in other files
// so that you don't have one huge page that you have to go up and
// down when you are writing code.
